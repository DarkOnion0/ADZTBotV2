> A little discord bot with a small footprint and easy to use to share music and video with your friends on your discord server

ADZTBotV2 is the successor of [ADZTBot](https://github.com/DarkOnion0/ADZTBot). It has been rewritten in go to make it
much faster, easier to deploy, easier to maintain...

## üöÄ Key Features

- Share music or video with your friends and vote for the post you like
- Support [Slash Commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ)

## üìñ Usage

To use the bot you just need to type `/` in the message box in discord and the bot command auto-completion will start,
pretty easy right ?!
